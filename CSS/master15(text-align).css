    direction: ltr; this is the default b/c 'en' (text-align have nothing to do with the direction it takes whatever
    (rtl/ltr) and put it at l/c/r.)
    you can know direction by the 'fullstop'
    =====
    vertical-align
    Affects the vertical positioning of the inline boxes generated by an inline-level element inside a line box.
    it can be top bottom middle

Note that vertical-align only applies to inline, inline-block and table-cell elements: you can't use it to vertically align block-level elements.
